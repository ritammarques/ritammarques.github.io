<p class="reveal"><b>Interaction design devotes itself to producing digital “things”. And those “things” are conditioned by the materials available.</b></p>
<p class="reveal">Before, the digital materials that we designers were used to work on, essentially consisted of glass based screens. But nowadays, with the developments in technology, we have much more than that, like the hybrid materials. These are blending physical (gestures and actions) and digital interaction (on-screen). It’s about offering a more immersive and interactive experience where the user becomes an active participant and not just a spectator. </p>
<p class="reveal"><a>Ex: VR, sensors that can detect movement, voice inputs, face scan and so on…</a></p>
<p class="reveal">We believe the authors are correct in their prediction that hybrid interfaces will replace simple glass screens with touch inputs. There’s a whole range of senses and motions that our bodies are capable of and that aren’t currently used to their full potential. Our hands are capable of feeling different textures and handling objects in very complex ways.  The authors mention <b>Soma Design</b>, to design more intuitive products, where we should root these in the way we handle everyday physical things: bringing more physicality to interaction design.</p>
<p class="reveal">More ways of inputting means that there could be many more ways of interacting with digital objects. Likewise, if these inputs take more advantage of our full range of motion and senses, more intuitive products and systems could be developed.</p>
<p class="reveal">However, this access to more senses of perception and more immersion could possibly result in a hedonistic society, that is focused on maximizing their pleasure using virtual environments and augmented reality, establishing a baseline of pleasure that the real world couldn’t possibly compete with, eventually detaching people from reality.</p>
<p class="reveal"><span>Where do we stop?<br>How much is enough?<br> Do we really want to create such dependency on technologies<br> restricting people from their more human interactions?</span></p>

            <h2>An increasingly<br>complex environment</h2>
<div>
    <p class="reveal"><b>We’re becoming more and more used to a complex world of ubiquitous, pervasive technology.</b></p>
    <p class="reveal">For some, it’s impossible to imagine a future without the devices, communication capabilities and overall interconnectedness that most of us have become accustomed to. Never before has it been so easy to access information, communicate with the world and  share experiences.</p>
    <p class="reveal">Everything is connected with everything else, and different stakeholders’ paths are increasingly intersecting, with their personal goals colliding. Furthermore, since the introduction of Web 2.0, every user can publish their own content online, having more influence over the development of systems and products, behaving more like co-developers. Even though we believe feedback and communication between both ends is important, we question their abilities to behave as such, since it is more and more common for them to take on the role of the designer, but the designer must not limit himself doing what he’s told.<br>
        The authors also argue that interaction designers now have a new role, not so much as shapers of user experience and digital products, but as facilitators of change. We tend to agree since the factors stated above contribute to the designers' inability to have creative freedom. This is a common reality but it’s also very contradictory to the creative nature of a designer. A designer designs, and that means making creative decisions.</p>
    <p class="reveal"><b>Design fixation</b> can have some positive sides for the user that likes intuitive and easy interfaces that work in expected ways. But as designers, we value creation, innovation, and evolution, and for that to happen, there needs to be change. Gravitating towards the same solutions only brings us to a regressive cycle. It often feels as though the only real driver of change in Interaction Design is technological advancements. We’ve become complacent in a system where we just use research data to develop things in accordance to rules, the so-called heuristics, and then pump out the correct solution to the problem. </p>
    <p class="reveal">And why would that be bad? Even nature follows rules. There are certain features and patterns in nature that are common to many of its creations, and it all works perfectly, as intended. Nature is only following the rules of the environment. However, even nature has an excellent mechanism to deal with design fixation: genetic mutation. This is nature’s way of being creative: it tries new things to see if they work, and if they don’t, it moves on to try other things! As designers, we need the freedom to experiment, to dream, to think of the many possibilities of interaction, and not just follow a list of requirements, while trying to make everyone happy.</p>

            <div>
                <p class="reveal"><b>There has been a recent “boom” in artificial intelligence technology.</b></p>
                <p class="reveal">Nowadays, the average person has access to text generators and chatbots (GPT-¾ and ChatGPT), image generators (Dall-E, Midjourney, etc.), deepfake technology, among many others. Interaction design on the other hand, seems to not be as prepared to deal with the future of AI. </p>
                <p class="reveal">Being capable of tailoring UI to specific users and their particular use cases, with modular designs. And having a website/app/product that could change drastically based on its use. Sounds good in theory, but as the article says, this could go against some <b>usability ideals</b>, like control, predictability, transparency, trust and reversibility. And with this, comes another serious problem. If Artificial Intelligence makes changes and develops new things over time, it also becomes harder for designers to stay in charge. Instead of working with the machine, they’ll find themselves working against it.</p>
                <p class="reveal"><span>Wouldn’t this be another way that designers could lose agency?<br>Could this infringe usability heuristics?<br>This remains to be seen. Maybe it's the heuristics that will need to change.<br>
                    Another question arises. When an AIs design decisions have negative impacts, whose fault is it?</span></p>
                <p class="reveal">If there’s a middle ground where the human can still have some impact on the AI’s decisions. Creating a cooperation between the mediums and taking the control from the machine, like <b>human-in-the-loop</b> as referred in the article. We agree that it can become a very useful tool for designers. A scenario where AI tries to take the designer’s place, replacing a human, is hard to believe. Artificial Intelligence is not yet capable of having human sensibilities since our brain is far too complex to be translated into 0’s and 1’s and lines of code.</p>
